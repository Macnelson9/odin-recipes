      common in the country of Nigeria and is relatively easy to make. P.s: The
      dish is deliciously delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups of beans</li>
      <li>1 cup of Sliced onions</li>
      <li>4 ripe plantains</li>
      <li>2-3 stock cubes</li>
      <li>200ml of palm oil</li>
      <li>500ml Ground red tomatoes</li>
      <li>Fluted pumpkin (optional)</li>
      <li>Ground Red Pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by picking the beans. Pick to separate sand and impurities from
        the beans, remove every unwanted material from the beans. That is just
        the essence of picking the beans. Nigerian beans come mixed with some
        unwanted materials. Parboil the picked beans for three to five minutes
        before following with the rest of the procedures. Just add to boiling
        water, cook for three to five minutes then wash and set aside in a bowl.
        Grind the fresh red tomatoes/pepper and set aside, also slice onions, we
        need a cup of sliced onions.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set your cooking pot on heat, add about two to three cups of water,
        allow to boil before adding the parboiled beans. cook for 40-50 minutes
        with just onions. I learned that adding onions at the beginning speeds
        up the cooking process of beans. Cook the beans for thirty to fifty
        minutes until it is very soft for consumption. You can check this by
        pressing the beans against your cooking spoon using your thumb.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set another pot on heat, add the palm oil and allow to heat for about 4
        minutes but don’t allow bleaching, add the ground tomatoes and allow it
        to fry, should take about 15-20 minutes. Once the beans are soft enough
        we proceed to next step.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add about a cup of water if the water is already dried, add the ground
        crayfish, stock cube, fried tomatoes/peppers. Add salt and pepper to
        taste. At this point you can add sliced ripe plantain in case you like
        them cooked, you can do this or fry the plantains separately. Cover and
        cook for another ten minutes, and you are done with the making of my
        favorite bean’s recipe. I like it watery, the same way you will find in
        the video below. But you can stir it for few seconds and allow it to
        thicken as it cools off.
