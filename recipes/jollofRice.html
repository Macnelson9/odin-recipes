    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is the famous Nigerian Jollof Rice Recipe. This dish is very
      common in the country of Nigeria and is relatively easy to make. P.s: The
      dish is deliciously delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups of rice</li>
      <li>1kg Chicken/beef</li>
      <li>1000ml of Ground Fresh Peppers</li>
      <li>50ml Ground Fresh peppers</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Nutmeg powder</li>
      <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
      <li>1 cup of sliced onions</li>
      <li>300ml vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes,
        half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions
        then let it sit for some minutes. Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15
        minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls. Peel off the outer back
        of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.
      </li>

      <li>
        Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add
        the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and
        wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic
        sieve.
      </li>

      <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>

      <li>
        Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1
        cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2
        minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the
        same oil I used while frying the meat. Using a fresh oil is just the
        same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds
        over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian
        foods. The end result is not the same.
      </li>

      <li>
        Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes. Fry until when you lift
        a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to
        boil in the spoon. You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock)
        to the fried tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a
        teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.
        Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly
        spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the rice. cooking jollof rice Then cover and allow the rice to cook
        on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water
        occasionally. Voila!!! Turn and serve with the fried meat of your choice
        and probably with your favorite drink too.
